## 🎯 Professional Focus

I work at the intersection of **life sciences, data analysis, and decision support**.  
My focus is on building **analytical frameworks that help inform strategic and operational decisions** in pharma, biotech, and healthcare — especially under scientific and market uncertainty.

I am positioning for **internship and entry-level roles** in healthcare analytics, life-science consulting support, strategy teams, and market/portfolio analysis functions.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

* Translate biological and clinical complexity into **structured analytical insights**
* Support decision-making with **quantitative models, comparisons, and trade-off analysis**
* Bridge **scientific context** with **business-oriented reasoning**
* Communicate results clearly for non-technical stakeholders

## 🛠️ Core Skill Set

### Analytical & Problem Structuring
- Structured problem decomposition (MECE-style thinking)
- Decision trees and scenario analysis
- Risk vs. reward comparisons under uncertainty
- Assumption-driven modeling

### Life Science & Healthcare Context
- Drug development lifecycle understanding
- Clinical trial logic and probability of success
- Therapeutic area and disease landscape analysis
- Regulatory and market access fundamentals (EMA / AMNOG awareness)

### Technical & Tooling
- Python (data analysis, logic, prototyping)
- SQL (data querying and structuring)
- Excel (financial and analytical models)
- PowerPoint (clear, structured communication)
- Basic ML & statistics for biomedical data

## 📂 Representative Projects

### 🔬 R&D Decision Support (Simulated / Academic)
- **Clinical Portfolio Evaluation**  
  Comparative analysis of hypothetical R&D assets using probability of success, timelines, and value drivers.

- **Capital Allocation Under Clinical Uncertainty**  
  Analytical framework to compare investment trade-offs across therapeutic areas (e.g., obesity & cardiometabolic disease).

- **Pharma Landscape Briefs**  
  Structured competitive and market overviews for selected therapeutic areas.

### 📊 Data & Informatics
- RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis (academic projects)
- Bioinformatics pipelines and data workflows
- Integration of biological data with downstream interpretation

> All projects are **analytical and educational** in nature and designed to demonstrate structured thinking, not real-world decision authority.

## 🧭 Target Roles (Realistic)

- Healthcare / Life Science Analyst (Intern / Working Student)
- Strategy or Consulting Intern (Healthcare-focused teams)
- Market Access / Portfolio Analytics Intern
- Digital Health or Pharma Operations Analyst
- Decision-support roles adjacent to R&D, not bench research

---

## 🎓 Education

**M.Sc. Life Science Informatics** — Germany  
- Bioinformatics, biostatistics, data mining, ML
- Biomedical data analysis and scientific computing

**B.Tech Biotechnology** — India  
- Molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry
- Strong foundation in life sciences

---

## 🔍 Positioning Summary

- Not pure R&D  
- Not pure software engineering  
- Strong in **analysis + life science context**
- Best fit for roles that **support decisions**, not make them

I am intentionally building toward **industry-facing, analytical roles** where scientific understanding and structured reasoning matter.
