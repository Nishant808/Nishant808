### 🎯 The Mission
I translate **scientific uncertainty into business clarity**. With a foundation in biotechnology and data informatics, I build frameworks to answer the most critical question in pharma and biotech: **"What should the company do next?"**

I am transitioning from technical execution to **decision-facing roles** in consulting, portfolio strategy, and market access.

### 🧪 Focus Areas
* **Consulting & Strategy:** Navigating complex pharma landscapes and competitive dynamics.
* **Capital Allocation:** Optimizing R&D spend across therapeutic areas under clinical uncertainty.
* **Regulatory Logic:** Aligning scientific development with market access and reimbursement constraints.
* **Decision Frameworks:** Building models where the **decision** dictates the **execution**, not the other way around.

---

### 📂 High-Impact Projects
* **Clinical Portfolio Prioritization:** Quantitative models to rank R&D assets based on probability of success ($PoS$) and $NPV$.
* **Pharma Landscape Analysis:** Competitive intelligence briefs for specific therapeutic areas.
* **Decision Briefs:** Translating complex biological data into actionable executive recommendations.
* **Healthcare Economics:** Case studies on market entry and reimbursement pathways (AMNOG/EMA/FDA).

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to:
* Life-science strategy or consulting case studies.
* Pharma/Biotech decision-analysis projects.
* Market access and health-econ modeling.

> **Fun Fact:** I’m intentionally moving away from the "wet lab" and "routine pipelines" to focus on the high-stakes decisions that determine if a drug ever reaches a patient.
