## 🎯 Professional Focus
At the intersection of **life sciences, data analysis, and strategic decision-making**.  
I build analytical tools and frameworks to support informed choices in pharma, biotech, and healthcare — focusing on uncertainty, trade-offs, and real-world impact.  

Shifting from pure research toward **applied analytics, portfolio strategy, and business-facing roles**.  

---

## 🧠 What I Bring
- **Analytical Thinking**: Decompose complex problems, model scenarios, evaluate risks/rewards, and structure decisions (e.g., MECE frameworks, decision trees).  
- **Data Translation**: Turn biological/clinical data into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.  
- **Tool-Building**: Prototype pipelines and dashboards to automate analysis and support strategy.  
- **Communication**: Deliver clear, structured reports and visuals for cross-functional teams.

## 📂 Key Projects
### 🔬 Bioinformatics & Data Analysis
**NetFragile – Biological Network Robustness Simulator**  
- Built Dash/Plotly web app with STRING API integration for real PPI network retrieval and NetworkX for centrality analysis.  
- Simulated random vs. targeted attacks, showing mycothiol pathway in *M. tuberculosis* collapses dramatically faster under hub targeting (LCC <20% after ~10–15% removal vs. >70% after 30% random).  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nishant808/NetFragile)  

**BioStreamline – GenBank File Analysis Pipeline**  
- Modular Python (Biopython) pipeline to automate sequence retrieval, feature extraction, and GC/content analysis.  
- Generated interactive Plotly plots for streamlined insights into distributions (CDS length, exons).  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nishant808/BioStreamline)  

**RNA-seq Analysis (LUAD)**  
- Analyzed 539 TCGA samples with TensorFlow/SHAP for biomarker identification; KEGG/GO enrichment confirmed 400x overrepresentation in lipid metabolism/immune signaling (FDR<0.05).  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nishant808/LUAD-DEG)  

### 📊 Analytics & Decision Support
**Strategic Data Modeling – Imbalanced Classification**  
- Optimized model to solve "Accuracy Trap," improving F1-score by 0.65 via Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP).  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nishant808/Imbalanced-Classification-Decision-Tree)  

**CreditWise – Loan Approval Prediction**  
- End-to-end ML pipeline on 1,000 records: EDA, feature engineering, Gaussian Naive Bayes (86% accuracy, 75% F1).
