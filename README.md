### 🚀 Strategic Projects (Featured)

**Strategic R&D Portfolio Optimization (Pharma Capital Allocation)** | *Python, ILP, DCF Modeling*
*Engineered a quantitative decision-support framework to allocate a theoretical **€500M fund** across global oncology assets.*

* **Capital Efficiency:** Processed **400,000+ clinical trial records** to isolate a high-signal "Investable Universe," utilizing **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to solve for maximum portfolio NPV under strict budget constraints.
* **Risk Pricing:** Applied a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model using industry-standard cumulative success probabilities (~10% Phase 1 to ~60% Phase 3) to value assets based on clinical maturity.
* **Technical Due Diligence:** Identified and corrected an "Enrollment Arbitrage" data anomaly where observational screening studies were misclassified as high-value therapeutic assets, implementing semantic filters to **de-risk the portfolio** and secure a valid **140% risk-adjusted ROI**.

**CreditWise – Loan Risk Prediction** | *Machine Learning, Financial Risk*

* Developed an end-to-end risk assessment pipeline using Gaussian Naive Bayes to predict loan defaults.
* Achieved **86% accuracy** in identifying high-risk profiles, demonstrating transferability of risk modeling from finance to biotech scenarios.

### 🔬 Technical & Research Projects

**NetFragile – Biological Network Robustness Simulator** | *NetworkX, Plotly*

* Simulated targeted attacks on PPI networks to model drug efficacy; demonstrated that targeting "Hub" proteins collapses the *M. tuberculosis* network **3x faster** than random attacks.
* Built an interactive Dash web app for real-time visualization of network resilience.

**RNA-seq Analysis (LUAD Biomarker Discovery)** | *TensorFlow, SHAP*

* Analyzed **539 TCGA samples** to identify lung adenocarcinoma biomarkers.
* Validated findings via KEGG/GO enrichment, confirming a **400x overrepresentation** in lipid metabolism pathways, translating complex genomic data into clear clinical insights.
